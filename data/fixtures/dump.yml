      <span class="faq_title"><a name="1"></a>I do not know even one word in Polish. Do you think this will be a problem in communication with Polish woman?</span>
      <span class="description">No, Polish woman who use this website speak at least basic English. When you meet her, ask her to teach you some Polish. This will open a new field for flirting and getting to know each other better.</span>
      <span class="faq_title"><a name="2"></a>Let's say she invites me to Poland. How do I go about going there? I've never been to Poland before!</span>
      <span class="description">Unlike Ukraine or Russia, Poland is relatively safe European country. Of course you always have to be careful, but no more than when going to Spain or Germany or, say Pittsburgh. There are some safety precautions though that apply to dating in or traveling any place in the world, be it New York, Warsaw or Paris. First, before going, write a note to your friend, sister etc. showing name, telephone number and address of the person who invited you. Where are you going and when are you planning to be back. Second, do not go straight to her house, however excited that would seem - book a room in the nearby hotel and invite her to hotel restaurant for the first meeting. You should also consider hiring recommended private guide or respectful tourist office to help you organize your visit. Please see articles section for more advice on going to Poland and read our Online Safety section. </span><br /><br />

      <a name="3" class="label">Special note to AOL users</a><br>
      <span class="textbig">A small percentage of America Online users may experience problems when using some of our features, experiencing blank white pages or lack of confirmation. If you are one of them then you have the following two options that may solve these problems.
      Please understand that our website is complete, everything here is working fine and accessed by millions around the world .. the problem you are experiencing, if any, is simply with your AOL built in browser and not with the structure of our site. Using the independent browser instead of the built-in AOL browser can solve many problems associated with accessing the World Wide Web through AOL... In few words we can say that AOL still has a long way to go before it can provide the same access to the internet, trouble free for its customers.
      <p>
      OPTION #1. Simply connect to the internet using any other Internet Service Provider such as Juno.com, MSN.com, or Earthlink.net and you will have none of the problems that you currently may be experiencing.<br>
      OPTION #2. If you do not wish to use switch to another Internet service provider then you can download and install a stand-alone version of Internet Explorer Web browser.
      <p>
      Here is the simplest way to proceed, Download the latest version of Microsoft's free browser Internet Explorer, security updates and service packs. http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm
      Install the downloaded browser software on your computer. (You'll find installation instructions at the Internet Explorer download Web site.)
      After you successfully install your new browser, restart your computer.
      Sign on to AOL and stay at the AOL Welcome page. (Note: You must sign on to AOL before proceeding.)
      Keep AOL running in the background (you can just minimize the window) and start your newly installed Internet Explorer. The new browser will use your AOL connection... but you will see for yourself what you have been missing by using AOL built in browser.
      If you wish to cancel your AOL account, call 1-888-265-8008. Or mail AOL at P.O. Box 1600/ Ogden, UT 84401 or FAX 801-622-7969. Specify that you're cancelling, give your full name, phone number and address, and either the primary billing contact's AOL screenname or the last four digits of the current payment method.

      <span class="imbra">If you are not a US citizen or US permanent resident, you don't need to read this page.</span>
      <p class="imbra">In March 2005 US Congress introduced a law that puts certain requirements on US men before they can date and marry foreign women. Our website fully complies with this law and you will be able to legally sponsor your future wife if you decide to do so.</p>
      <p class="imbra">This law, called International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 (or simply IMBRA), has received widespread criticism from both Internet users as well as from owners of Internet dating services throughout the United States. </p>
      <p class="imbra">Instead of adding to this criticism, we simply created a website that fully complies with IMBRA. Please note that using online service that do not comply with IMBRA, may jeopardize any plans for marriage with your non-US fiancee. Some website only say they comply with IMBRA, but in fact they don't. We recommend that you call your nearest Customs and Immigration Bureau to find out if the website you're going to use is on the "black list". If it is, don't use it. </p>

      <span class="rule_description">By accessing the Service or becoming a Member of the Service, you consent to have this Agreement provided to you in electronic form.</span>
      <span class="rule_title">3. Modification of the Agreement</span>
      <span class="rule_description">You understand and agree that PolishRomance.com may amend or modify these Terms or impose new conditions at any time by updating these Terms.
